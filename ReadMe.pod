=head1 SYNOPSIS

    > zild
    > # Edit the Meta file.
    > make release

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a formalization of a Perl package directory layout and release
process that I have been evolving for some time. I use the same layout for
Bash, Ruby, Python and Node.js package publishing.

Zilla::Dist provides a Makefile and set of scripts that take a modern code
layout and transform it into something that looks like a standard old Perl
distribution. Under the hood C<zild> generates everything that Dist::Zilla
wants and lets C<dzil> do the heavy lifting, but you never need to interact
with C<Dist::Zilla> stuff directly.

=head2 Directory Layout

A fully stacked top level CPAN package repository might look like this:

    Changes         # History in YAML
    Contributing    # A generated insruction file for contributing
    Makefile        # Automation of test, dist, publish, etc
    Meta            # Meta info for all metadata needs (including dzil)
    ReadMe.pod      # Generated from `doc/Module.swim`
    bin/            # Scripts
    doc/            # Swim docs
    ext/            # External repos (subrepos)
    eg/             # Examples
    lib/            # Perl `.pm` code
    pkg/            # Packaging related files
    note/           # Project notes, todo lists, ideas, specs, etc
    share/          # Shared files to distribute
    test/           # Test suite
    .travis.yml     # Travis file (generated)

Note a few things:

=over

=item * Sane / readable names

=item * Directories are lowercase / never plural

=item * Files are TitleCase

=item * No file extensions (if possible)

=item * No extra meta files like C<dist.ini>, C<.travis.yml>, C<bower.json> etc

=back

These are the I<best of> from all the package systems I've used. They make me
happy, and not tied to poor legacy standards.

=head2 Zilla::Dist

Zilla::Dist provides a Makefile to do everything. You get a new Makefile with:

    > zild [setup]

And you can refresh it later with:

    > make update

Run C<make help> to get a list of all the targets. Here are the most
important targets:

=over

=item C<make release>

Build the dist, then C<cpan-upload> it.

=item C<make test>

Run the test suite.

=item C<make install>

Build and install the software. Same as install from CPAN.

=item C<make prereqs>

Install the prereqs from CPAN that are listed in the C<Meta> file's
C<requires:> field.

=item C<make cpan>

Turn repo into a C<Dist::Zilla> ready subdirectory called C<./cpan/>. This
directory has a C<dist.ini> file.

=item C<make dist>

Basically the same as C<make cpan; cd cpan; dzil build>.

=back

=head1 USAGE

Start by running:

    zild

and you'll get a C<Makefile> and a C<Meta> file template. You need to
customize the C<Meta> file and leave the C<Makefile> alone.

To do a release, just set a new C<version> in the Meta file and add a
C<Changes> section using the same version. Then run:

    make release

This will:

=over

=item * Make sure things are ready for release.

=item * Make a dzil ready directory of your stuff called C<./cpan/>.

=item * Call C<dzil build>.

=item * Call C<cpan-upload> to send the dist to CPAN.

=item * Tag the git repo with the version string.

=item * C<git push> the repo and tag upstream.

=back

=head2 Release in Depth

This section lists all the things that actually happen during the C<make
release> step.

I<â¦to be completedâ¦>

=head1 RATIONALE RANTING

I've published a lot of I<packages> in a lot of programming languages. I like
taking the best ideas and spreading them around. I like reusing ideas and code
and tools as much as possible between these packages.

I trust dzil to DTRT with regard to the CPAN release process. I use almost the
exact same C<dist.ini> for some 50 CPAN packages that I've converted so far.

I don't like cluttered repos and adding new I<metadata> files for each new
tool that needs one. The C<dist.ini> file is not bad, but I can generate it
from metadata easily. So I do.

As much as these great new ideas differ from the norm, I want my CPAN
publishings to be normal to normal mongers (if there's such a thing). The
C<make releasse> process does just that. End users would have to look hard to
know this wasn't a "normal" dzil release.

I'm packaging this packaging process as L<Zilla::Dist> for others to use. It's
also a decent example of a CPAN package packaged with itself.

=head1 NOTES

Unlike C<dzil>, the only C<zild> command you ever use is C<zild> (with no
arguments) to get the Zilla::Dist C<Makefile> and C<Meta> file. After that,
all Zilla::Dist commands are C<make> targets.

Some of the tools in Zilla::Dist are Bash, some are Perl. I'm doing a lot in
the area of Bash Package packaging. See L<http://bpan.org>.

I use the term C<Package> where CPAN people have used the term
C<Distribution>. Perl is the only language (in my packaging experience) to do
so.

The name C<t/> is another outlier. The most common is C<test/> followed by
C<tests/>.

I don't like plural directory names. Try singular. I think you'll like it too.

ALLCAPSFILENAMES ARE TOO LOUD! ChillOut.

=head2 Commiting Generated Code/Files

People think that committing generated code/files is a bad idea and in general
I concur, but there are exceptions.

Sometimes tools like Travis-CI require you to commit a config file.
Zilla::Dist generates these files from metadata, which is a whole lot easier
than maintaining them yourself, but you end up commiting generated code.

The C<dist.ini> file is only needed locally, however, during dist build time,
so no need to commit that.

In general, when an external tool requires files, and it's easiest to generate
those files, it's OK to commit generated code.
